# Python Practice: Adding Two Numbers: 4/16/2023

# Example 1:
# Input: num1 = 5, num2 = 3
# Output: 8

# Example 2:
# Input: num1 = 13, num2 = 6
# Output: 19

# Python program adding two numbers:

num1 = 15
num2 = 12

# Adding two nos

sum = num1 + num2
# Variable one (num1) and Variable two (num2).  Sum = two Varaibles together.

# Print values:
print(sum)

# Python program adding two numbners provided by user input:

number1 = input("7")
number2 = input("14")

# Adding two numbers.
# User might also enter floating points.
sum = number1 + number2
print("sum number1 + number2")

# To define a function that takes two intergers and rturn the sum of those two numbers:
#def = The keyword used to create, (or define) a Function.
